# else Heart.Break() Toolkit

### The all in one Toolkit for the game "else Heart.Break()"


#### Features:
###### 1. Locking and Unlocking of doors
###### 2. Locate specific items,doors,character etc.
###### 3. Weather change ~ Game uses numbers from 0-100(0 = clear day, 100 = Stormy day)
###### 4. Teleport to a specific item, door, character etc.


## Future considerations
##### 1. Be able to save room,doors,items names for easier access after the initial setup
##### 2. Any other ideas that might come to my mind and I will try to implement them or maybe automate some of the existing ones



## How-To
##### 1. Find an object that can run code (Preferably a fusebox)
##### 2. Copy and paste the Setup.sprak script in the fusebox and run the script
##### 3. You will see that now you have a new item in your inventory called "computer"
##### 4. Equip the computer, place it down and copy and paste the Toolkit.sprak script in it and you are ready to go
