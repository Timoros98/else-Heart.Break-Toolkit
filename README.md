# else Heart.Break() Toolkit

### The all in one Toolkit for the game "else Heart.Break()"


#### Features:
###### 1. Locking and Unlocking of doors
###### 2. Locate specific items
###### 3. Moving items to locations or player invetory
###### 4. Weather change ~ Game uses numbers from 1-4(1 = clear day, 4 = Stormy day)
###### 5. Teleport to a specific item, door, character etc.


### Am considering this the main fetures for now and keep building on them and make them more advanced

## Future considerations
##### 1. Better Teleporter
##### 2. Be able to save room,doors,items names for easier access after the initial setup
##### 3. Different script where it will automatically setup for you a computer in your inventory where you can paste the main script and run the commands wherever you want
##### 4. Any other ideas that might come to my mind and I will try to implement them or maybe automate some of the existing ones



## How-To
##### 1. Find an object that can run code (Preferably a fusebox)
##### 2. Copy and paste the Setup.sprak script in the fusebox and run the script
##### 3. You will see that now you have a new item in your inventory called "computer"
##### 4. Equip the computer, place it down and copy and paste the Toolkit.sprak script in it and you are ready to go
